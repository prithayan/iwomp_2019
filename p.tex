\begin{abstract}
OpenMP has made it convenient to port an existing application from CPU to heterogeneous systems like GPUs. Starting from 4.5 standard, target offloading features can be used to offload individual kernels to the GPU and other devices. 
Several users have noted that one of the most challenging and error-prone tasks is the memory management for the device offloading. 
% Typically developers spend majority of their time, understanding
% the correct usage and performance implications 
% of the target \texttt{map} clause.  

In this paper, we present a static analysis tool, 
OmpSan, a code sanitizer, that helps the developers understand the 
correct usage and performance implications of
the target \texttt{map} clause. We present several 
case-studies to show the effectiveness of our powerful analysis.
OmpSan can detect bugs resulting from incorrect usage of 
\texttt{map} clause, and also report diagnostic information
 and simple fixes for the bug.
