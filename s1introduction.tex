Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) is a widely used directive-based parallel programming model
that  supports offloading computations from hosts to accelerator devices such as GPUs. 
% which offers accelerator programming and supports heterogeneous
% computing systems with host CPUs and device accelerators (currently
% GPUs and FPGAs) from version 4.0 onwards.  
Notable accelerator-related features 
in OpenMP include unstructured data
mapping, asynchronous execution, and runtime routines for device
memory management.

\subsubsection{OMP Target offloading and Data mapping}
OMP offers the \texttt{omp target} directive 
for offloading computations to devices and the \texttt{omp target data}
directive for mapping data across the host and the corresponding
device data environment.
% is used to generate a target 
% task that can be offloaded to a device, and also to map variables 
% to the device data environment. 
% The \textit{omp target data} directive explicitly maps variables 
% from a host environment to a device data environment.
On heterogeneous systems, managing the movement of data between the host and the device can be challenging, and is often a major source of performance and correctness bugs. 
In the OpenMP accelerator model, 
% hosts and devices have their own memory space – i.e., data environments – and 
data movement between device and host 
is supported either explicitly via the use of a \texttt{map} clause 
or, implicitly through default data-mapping rules. 
The optimal, or even correct, specification of map clauses can be non-trivial and error-prone because it requires users to reason about the complex dataflow analysis. 
To ensure that the map clauses are correct, the OpenMP programmers 
need to make sure that variables that are defined in one data environments and used in another data environments are mapped accordingly across 
the different device and host data environments. 
Given a data map construct, its semantics depends on all the previous usages of the map construct.
Therefore, dataflow analysis of map clauses is necessarily 
context-sensitive since the entire call sequence leading up to a specific 
map construct can impact its behavior.
% To ensure that the map clauses are correct, OpenMP programmers 
% need to identify statements 
% that define variables involved in target clauses, and
% each definition of such a variable to all the uses that can be 
% reached by it in the program.

% correct specification of \texttt{map} clause is non-trivial and 
% error-prone because it requires element-wise dataflow analysis to

% program points and variables/array elements.

\subsection{OpenMP 5.0 Map Semantics}
\autoref{mapSemantics} shows a schematic illustration 
of the set of rules used when mapping 
a host variable to the corresponding list item 
in the device data environment, as specified 
in the OpenMP 5.0 standard. The rest of this paper 
 assumes that the accelerator device is a GPU, and that mapping 
a variable from host to device introduces a host-to-device memory copy, 
and vice-versa. 
However, the bugs that we identify reflect errors in the OpenMP 
code regardless of the target device. 

The different map types that OpenMP 5.0 supports are, 
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-5pt}
 \item \texttt{alloc}: allocate on device, uninitialized
 \item \texttt{to}: map to device before kernel execution, (host-device memory copy)
 \item \texttt{from}:  map from device after kernel execution (device-host memory copy)
 \item \texttt{tofrom}: copy in and copy out the variable at the entry and exit of the device environment  
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-9pt}
%% The default map type for arrays is \textit{tofrom}, 
%% % that is copy in and copy out the array at the entry and exit of 
%% % the device enviro nment. 
%% while the default for scalars
%% is \textit{firstprivate}, that is the only copy the value of the 
%% scalar at the entry to the device environment.
Arrays are implicitly mapped as \texttt{tofrom}, while scalars are firstprivate 
 in the target region implicitly, {\em i.e.,} the value of the scalar on the host
is copied to the corresponding item on the device only at the entry to the device
environment.

% The OpenMP 5.0 specification specifies the semantics of the \textit{map}
% clause, and \autoref{mapSemantics} illustrates how the spec 
% interprets the data map constructs. 
% The flowchart also motivates our argument that understanding the \textit{map} clause is not trivial, it 
%  shows the complex set of rules defined in the OpenMP 5.0 spec, 
% that is used to determine how to map a  host variable to the corresponding list item in the device data environment.
% We make a simplifying assumption that the CPU host is the current 
% task's data environment and the device is a GPU, and hence the mapping from the host to the device
% refers to the Device-Host and Host-device memory copy.
As \autoref{mapSemantics} shows, OpenMP 5.0 specification uses the reference count of a variable, to decide when to introduce 
a device/host memory copy. The host to device memory copy is 
introduced only when the reference count is incremented from 0 to 1 and the \texttt{to} attribute is present. 
Then the reference count is incremented every time a 
new device map environment is created. 
The reference count is decremented on encountering a \texttt{from} or \texttt{release} 
attribute, while exiting the data environment. 
Finally, when the reference count is decremented to zero from 1, and the 
\texttt{from} attribute is present, 
the variable is mapped back to the host from the device.
% \autoref{statemachine} shows an example state machine, 
% to decide when to insert the memory copies.

\subsection{The Problem}
For target offloading, the map clause is used to map variables from a 
task's data environment to the corresponding variable in the device 
data environment. Incorrect data map clauses can result in 
usage of 
stale data in either host or device data environment, 
which may result in the following kinds of issues, 
% Now if a map clause is used incorrectly, 
% then the read of a variable can return stale data.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The variable on the device data environment, does not contain 
 the updated values of its original variable.
 \item The original variable was not updated with the latest value of 
 the device environment variable.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Our Solution}
% \vspace{-50pt}
We propose a static analysis 
tool called OMPSan to perform OpenMP code ``sanitization''.
OMPSan is a compile-time tool, which statically verifies  
the correctness of the  data mapping constructs based on a dataflow analysis.
The key principle guiding our approach is that: {\em an OpenMP program is expected to yield the same result when enabling
or disabling OpenMP constructs}.
% this issue as first-aid error detection, we propose a
% compile-time approach based on dataflow analysis. 
% The key principle guiding our error detection approach is that
% ``A user program yields the same result when enabling or disabling
% OpenMP constructs''.
% \footnote{With the exception of privatization clauses, which is unrelated to our goal, and beyond the scope of this work}.
Our approach detects errors by comparing the 
dataflow information (reaching definitions via
LLVM's memory SSA representation \cite{llvm-memoryssa-url}) 
between the OpenMP and baseline code.  We developed an
LLVM-based implementation of our approach and evaluated its
effectiveness using several case studies.
Our specific contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
% \vspace{-3pt}
\item an algorithm to analyze OpenMP runtime library calls inserted by Clang in the LLVM IR, to infer the host/device memory copies. We expect 
that this algorithm will have applications beyond our OMPSan tool. 
% according to OpenMP 5.0 semantics
\item a static analysis technique to validate if the host/device memory copies respect the original memory def-use relations. 
% \item Reporting error/warnings on usage of data mapping constructs 
% on given user programs
\item diagnostic information for users to understand how the map clause affects the 
host and device data environment. 
\end{itemize}
Even though our algorithm is based on clang OpenMP implementation, 
it can very easily be applied to other approaches like using directives 
to delay the OpenMP lowering to a later LLVM pass.

The paper is organized as follows. 
\autoref{s2} provides motivating examples to describe 
the common issues and difficulties in using 
OpenMP's \textit{data map} construct. 
\autoref{s03} provides the background information 
that we use in our analysis.
\autoref{s3} presents an overview of our approach to validate 
the usage of data mapping constructs. 
\autoref{s4} presents the LLVM implementation details, and 
\autoref{s5} presents the evaluation and some case studies. 
\autoref{limitation} also lists some of the limitations of 
our tool, some of them common to any static analysis.  
% \vspace{-20pt}
% According to the OpenMP 5.0 semantics, the \texttt{target}, 
% \texttt{target data}, and the \texttt{target enter data} 
% constructs maps host variables to a device data environment. Essentially 
% for the GPU, it inserts host-device and device-host memory copies. 
% The \texttt{map} clause is used to specify how a variable is mapped 
% from the host to the device environment.
